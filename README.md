# Solar-Position-Charger
For my class Embededd Interfacing i had to make a rather large project with some requirements:

−μprocessor :  Atmega 328P.

−Display (LCD ,Touchscreen), control leds.

−Interface: SPI, I2C, Digital I/O, Analog I/O.

−Wireless connection with internet/cloud.

−ISP programming.

−Flexibele environment, multi functinal.

I ended up with inventing a system that would make solar charging more efficiënt. I wanted to be able to move the solar panels straight to the sun. Also I wanted to monitor how much power I am consuming and how much power I'm generating. This way I could make the system smarter. And analyste the power of the sun trough the year. Then I wanted to be able to access all this data live from a dynamic webpage and also put this data in a database to analyse this data later on. 

So with my idea in mind i started thinking about wich components i needed and ordered those. 

- 2 INA219s power measurement IC's.

- 1 MCP73831 charging IC.
